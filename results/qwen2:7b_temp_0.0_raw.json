{ "type": "clinical case", "description": "A previously healthy 52-year-old Caucasian man presented with a tonic-clonic seizure followed by a diagnosis of an atypical meningioma confirmed through craniotomy and resection. Postoperatively, he was treated with phenytoin for seizures but developed symptoms consistent with generalized seizures nine days later. After two months, the patient complained of blood in his stool and was diagnosed with locally advanced nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the low rectum. He received neoadjuvant radiation therapy with capecitabine, which led to elevated phenytoin levels and symptoms of toxicity. Capecitabine was discontinued, and the patient showed no further toxicity after treatment with charcoal and observation. The patient resumed radiation therapy without concurrent capecitabine and was monitored for phenytoin levels, eventually discontinuing lacosamide due to concerns about toxicity. He underwent surgical resection followed by adjuvant capecitabine and showed no signs of recurrence three years later but passed away from recurrent meningioma." }
