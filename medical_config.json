    "We report the case of a 33-year-old woman who was previously diagnosed on the rheumatology ward in January 2014 due to unexplained weight loss, anaemia and highly elevated systemic inflammation markers (C-reactive protein of 129 ng/ml, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 107 mm/h). These findings were accompanied by severe dizziness and an extremely low value of systemic blood pressure measured on both arms. Doppler ultrasound (DUS) examination followed by computed tomography angiography (angio-CT; Mar 2014) revealed thickening of the descending aorta wall, near-to-occlusion stenosis of both common carotid arteries (CCA), severe stenosis of the right subclavian artery (RSA) and occlusion of the left subclavian artery (LSA) as well as the right axillary artery. According to the criteria of large vessel vasculitis a diagnosis of TA was made [] and the patient was initiated on a combination therapy of cyclophosphamide, prednisolone and hydrocortisone. Within the next 6 months, she was hospitalized several times due to persistent neurological symptoms including dizziness and drop attacks. In December 2014 clinical deterioration with increased neurological symptoms occurred. The patient was unable to adopt an upright position because of severe dizziness; moreover, right-hemisphere TIA occurred. She was admitted to our Vascular Surgery Department in January 2015. After complex non-invasive diagnostic evaluation and multidisciplinary team (neurologist, vascular surgeon, cardiologist, angiologist) consultation she was scheduled for invasive aortic arch angiography in terms of endovascular treatment. Via right femoral access, a 6 Fr diagnostics pigtail catheter was introduced. Angiography revealed: occlusion of the LSA, occlusion of the left CCA, significant narrowing of the innominate artery (IA), long, 95% stenosis of right CCA, and 80% stenosis of the RSA ( A). Cerebral filling was extremely poor, mainly from collateral circulation ( B). The right vertebral artery was the only patent vessel supplying the brain. In accordance with ischemic symptoms and predicted procedure feasibility it was decided to perform angioplasty of vessels supplying the right hemisphere. On diagnostics, an Imager II Bern 5 Fr catheter, V-18 Control Wire (0.0018 in) was navigated through the IA to the RSA. The diagnostic catheter was then replaced with a 40° angled 8 Fr Mach1 Peripheral Guide Catheter (all above from Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA). The right CCA and ICA were wired with a coronary BMW 0.014 in wire (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and predilatation of the right CCA with a 2.5 × 20 mm coronary balloon catheter was performed (two inflations at 12 atm and 14 atm for 20 s each). FilterWire EZ (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA), a distal neuroprotection device, was introduced and opened in the right ICA. Two inflations at 6 atm/60 s using a 5.0 × 60 mm IN PACT Admiral Drug Eluting Balloon (DEB; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were performed in the right CCA covering the whole stenotic segment ( C). In spite of long inflations the patient complained only of temporary inflation-related right-side neck pain. As significant dissection of the proximal and middle part of the right CCA (RCCA) occurred ( D), two self-expandable stents (Precise PRO 8.0 × 40 mm distally, 9.0 × 30 mm proximally; Cordis Fremont, CA, USA) were implanted, covering the dissected segment as well as the artery ostium and bifurcation with the RSA. Postdilatation with a 5.0 × 20 mm balloon catheter (2 × 12 atm/20 s) was done ( E, F). The next target was the RSA. Stent struts covering the RSA ostium were crossed with a 0.014 in HT BMW 0.014 in wire and then predilated with a 2.0 × 20 mm balloon catheter. A coronary, drug-eluting stent (DES, Xience Pro 4.0 × 23 mm (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA)) was implanted at 18 atm/30 s and post-dilated with a 5.0 × 20 mm balloon catheter at 14 atm/40 s ( G). A filter from the RICA was retrieved very easily. In control angiography correct location of stents with no residual stenosis and significant blood flow improvement to both hemispheres were recorded ( H, I). Within the next 12 h significant improvement of general status and reduction of neurological symptoms were observed. The patient was discharged after 4 days of hospitalization on dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 75 mg/daily permanently and clopidogrel 75 mg/daily for 6 months). Control DUS performed 4 weeks later demonstrated good flow through implanted stents with no signs of restenosis. Three and 8 months after the procedure, control angio-CT revealed patency of all stents and no new stenotic lesions of treated vessels (). Up to now, the patient has remained in good clinical status without any neurological disorders.",
    "We report the single clinical case of a 61-year-old right-handed male patient suffered a brainstem ischemic stroke caused by a thrombosis of the basilar artery and a dissection of the right vertebral artery at 55 years of age. He was treated with thrombolytic drugs, which proved ultimately ineffective and did not prevent the induction of irreversible stroke damage in several brain regions. T1 sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images acquired at the time of admission in the emergency room revealed a large lesion in the bulbo-pontine junction impinging on part of the left cerebral peduncle, and also small areas of ischemic damage in right cerebellar and left capsulo-thalamic structures. The patient was clinically diagnosed with an incomplete locked-in syndrome and tetra-paresia. Months following the stroke, the patient started several motor rehabilitation regimes aiming to preserve further functional loss and eventually improve the function of his four limbs, his face and trunk, favoring walking, equilibrium and allowing manual control of an automated wheelchair, ensuring for the patient a certain level of autonomy. After ~4 years of intense rehabilitation, the clinical status of the patient was characterized by a severe dysarthria and enduring tetra-paresia, impacting dramatically the left side of his body, including his left upper and lower limbs, and allowing only slight voluntary movements with his left fifth hand finger. In contrast, motion of his right hemibody parts was better preserved, allowing him to mobilize himself by operating an automated wheelchair with wrist flexion/extension movements. Regardless, his right hand opened incompletely and fine finger motor skills remained very limited, making manipulation of small items impossible. Additional rehabilitation regimes were implemented to improve swallowing difficulties (often conveying saliva and food to respiratory airways) and phonation disorders, which both endured regardless of the rehabilitation regimes. Oral communication was affected, nonetheless, the patient remained at all times fully able to understand verbal and written language and follow instructions. A neuropsychological assessment suggested significant memory encoding impairments, and limited attention and mental flexibility.\\nForty-nine months (~4 years) following the stroke event, the patient experienced AHs as “someone speaking to him on his left ear” and reported such as the voice of his female speech therapist. He also suffered a continuous flow of persecutory AHs, described as voices professing insults addressed to his person. Nonetheless, AHs were not spontaneously reported to medical personnel by the patient himself but rather communicated by his relatives. Importantly, the patient did not show any prior history of psychiatric disorders or drug abuse before stroke. AHs initially disappeared spontaneously 3 months following the onset of such events. Nonetheless, only 9 months thereafter, AHs reappeared under an even more disturbing form, preventing the patient from sleeping and triggering unprecedented aggressive behavior. AHs were initially treated with neuroleptic medication (hemibody, 3 mg/day orally), however, this treatment was subsequently discontinued due to poor tolerance. Nineteen months later, the patient experienced again AHs, this time associated with a paranoid delusion and a depressive syndrome. Delusion and depression disappeared with antidepressant medication (Paroxetine, 20 mg/day orally), nonetheless AHs persisted.\\nA previously tested therapeutic regime using low-frequency (1 Hz) rTMS delivered to the left TPJ (, ) was prescribed to treat hallucinatory symptoms reported as being highly impairing and disabling by patient’s relatives. The first 1 Hz rTMS session over the left TPJ was delivered 20 months following the onset of AHs and 69 months (i.e., 5 years and 9 months) following the stroke event. Figure indicate the different events (stroke, episodes of AHs, and rTMS therapy) presented in this clinical case. At the time of arrival, the patient was taking aspirin (Kardegic, 300 mg/day orally) to thin the blood and prevent clots; bromide pyridostigmine (Mestinon, 60 mg/day orally) for the treatment of myasthenia and intestinal tonus loss and a proton pump inhibitor (Lansoprazole, 15 mg/day orally) to prevent gastric acidity and reflux.",
    "A previously healthy, 52-year-old Caucasian man presented to his family physician a week after having a tonic-clonic seizure. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed a 10 cm left frontal tumor, which was confirmed as an atypical meningioma following craniotomy and resection (Figure ).\\nPostoperatively, he took 400 mg of phenytoin PO once a day. He had no seizures postoperatively or afterward. The patient uneventfully received 60 Gy of adjuvant radiation therapy to the postoperative bed in 30 fractions. Three months after the resection of the tumor, the patient began a trial of phenytoin but nine days later, he developed symptoms consistent with a generalized seizure. He resumed his daily phenytoin prophylaxis with good effect.\\nTwo months later, he complained of blood in the stool and after an evaluation was diagnosed with a locally advanced nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the low rectum (Figure ). A curative-intent dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions of neoadjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed, with 2000 mg PO BID of concurrent radiosensitizing capecitabine []. After 20 of the planned 28 fractions, he began to feel unwell and experienced new, right-sided upper and lower limb dysfunction and an unsteady gait. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed no suspicious findings but his phenytoin level was dramatically elevated at 138 µmol/L, compared to 49 µmol/L just prior to neoadjuvant therapy (normal range: 40-80 µmol/L). His albumin level from a few weeks prior to these symptoms had also been normal at 39 g/L (normal range: 34-46 g/L), and he was taking no other medications other than an occasional stimulant laxative. Capecitabine was discontinued, and the patient was treated with charcoal and admitted for observation. Phenytoin was temporarily discontinued and then reintroduced at the previous dose of 400 mg PO per day once levels began to normalize. His symptoms quickly resolved and he showed no further toxicity.\\nHe resumed radiation therapy a few days later without concurrent capecitabine. It was believed that he had developed phenytoin toxicity secondary to impaired clearance as a result of his capecitabine. His phenytoin levels were monitored during the following weeks and his phenytoin dose was bridged with lacosamide and titrated down gradually and then discontinued, with no further symptoms of toxicity. The patient remained on 200 mg PO per day of lacosamide. He underwent a surgical resection with clear margins followed by adjuvant capecitabine and showed no signs of a recurrence of rectal adenocarcinoma thereafter. Three years later, the patient passed away from recurrent meningioma."
