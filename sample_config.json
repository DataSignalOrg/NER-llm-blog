    "We report the case of a 33-year-old woman who was previously diagnosed on the rheumatology ward in January 2014 due to unexplained weight loss, anaemia and highly elevated systemic inflammation markers (C-reactive protein of 129 ng/ml, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 107 mm/h). These findings were accompanied by severe dizziness and an extremely low value of systemic blood pressure measured on both arms. Doppler ultrasound (DUS) examination followed by computed tomography angiography (angio-CT; Mar 2014) revealed thickening of the descending aorta wall, near-to-occlusion stenosis of both common carotid arteries (CCA), severe stenosis of the right subclavian artery (RSA) and occlusion of the left subclavian artery (LSA) as well as the right axillary artery. According to the criteria of large vessel vasculitis a diagnosis of TA was made [] and the patient was initiated on a combination therapy of cyclophosphamide, prednisolone and hydrocortisone. Within the next 6 months, she was hospitalized several times due to persistent neurological symptoms including dizziness and drop attacks. In December 2014 clinical deterioration with increased neurological symptoms occurred. The patient was unable to adopt an upright position because of severe dizziness; moreover, right-hemisphere TIA occurred. She was admitted to our Vascular Surgery Department in January 2015. After complex non-invasive diagnostic evaluation and multidisciplinary team (neurologist, vascular surgeon, cardiologist, angiologist) consultation she was scheduled for invasive aortic arch angiography in terms of endovascular treatment. Via right femoral access, a 6 Fr diagnostics pigtail catheter was introduced. Angiography revealed: occlusion of the LSA, occlusion of the left CCA, significant narrowing of the innominate artery (IA), long, 95% stenosis of right CCA, and 80% stenosis of the RSA ( A). Cerebral filling was extremely poor, mainly from collateral circulation ( B). The right vertebral artery was the only patent vessel supplying the brain. In accordance with ischemic symptoms and predicted procedure feasibility it was decided to perform angioplasty of vessels supplying the right hemisphere. On diagnostics, an Imager II Bern 5 Fr catheter, V-18 Control Wire (0.0018 in) was navigated through the IA to the RSA. The diagnostic catheter was then replaced with a 40° angled 8 Fr Mach1 Peripheral Guide Catheter (all above from Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA). The right CCA and ICA were wired with a coronary BMW 0.014 in wire (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and predilatation of the right CCA with a 2.5 × 20 mm coronary balloon catheter was performed (two inflations at 12 atm and 14 atm for 20 s each). FilterWire EZ (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA), a distal neuroprotection device, was introduced and opened in the right ICA. Two inflations at 6 atm/60 s using a 5.0 × 60 mm IN PACT Admiral Drug Eluting Balloon (DEB; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were performed in the right CCA covering the whole stenotic segment ( C). In spite of long inflations the patient complained only of temporary inflation-related right-side neck pain. As significant dissection of the proximal and middle part of the right CCA (RCCA) occurred ( D), two self-expandable stents (Precise PRO 8.0 × 40 mm distally, 9.0 × 30 mm proximally; Cordis Fremont, CA, USA) were implanted, covering the dissected segment as well as the artery ostium and bifurcation with the RSA. Postdilatation with a 5.0 × 20 mm balloon catheter (2 × 12 atm/20 s) was done ( E, F). The next target was the RSA. Stent struts covering the RSA ostium were crossed with a 0.014 in HT BMW 0.014 in wire and then predilated with a 2.0 × 20 mm balloon catheter. A coronary, drug-eluting stent (DES, Xience Pro 4.0 × 23 mm (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA)) was implanted at 18 atm/30 s and post-dilated with a 5.0 × 20 mm balloon catheter at 14 atm/40 s ( G). A filter from the RICA was retrieved very easily. In control angiography correct location of stents with no residual stenosis and significant blood flow improvement to both hemispheres were recorded ( H, I). Within the next 12 h significant improvement of general status and reduction of neurological symptoms were observed. The patient was discharged after 4 days of hospitalization on dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 75 mg/daily permanently and clopidogrel 75 mg/daily for 6 months). Control DUS performed 4 weeks later demonstrated good flow through implanted stents with no signs of restenosis. Three and 8 months after the procedure, control angio-CT revealed patency of all stents and no new stenotic lesions of treated vessels (). Up to now, the patient has remained in good clinical status without any neurological disorders."
